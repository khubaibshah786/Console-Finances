## User Acceptance Criteria

### Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------

  Total Months: 86

  Total: $38382578

  Average Change: -2315.12
